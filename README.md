## Disease Symptom Image Generator  

### Description  
A Python-based project utilizing Stable Diffusion to generate realistic images of disease symptoms based on text descriptions. This project enhances datasets by associating generated images with specific symptoms, aiding in visualization and comprehension for various use cases like medical research and AI applications.

### 2. Features  

- **Automated Image Generation:**  
  Generates high-quality images of symptoms based on textual input.  
- **Dataset Enhancement:**  
  Integrates generated image paths into a CSV file alongside corresponding symptom data.  
- **Customizable Descriptions:**  
  Allows for fine-tuning image generation parameters to match specific visual requirements.  
- **Streamlined Workflow:**  
  Designed to seamlessly fit into AI projects, including chatbots or predictive systems.  

### 3. Technologies Used  

- Python  
- Stable Diffusion (for text-to-image generation)  
- PIL (Pillow) for image processing  
- Pandas for CSV file manipulation  
- Hugging Face Diffusers (optional) for enhanced control over image generation
